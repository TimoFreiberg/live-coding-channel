# Live coding a channel in Rust

The results of https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Community-Stuttgart/events/nnmzcsyccjbnb/

The library I'm taking inspiration from: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-channel (and its dependency https://github.com/smol-rs/concurrent-queue)

Good resources that explain things a lot better than I do:
